## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

I worked with Visual Studio Code and Python Version 3.11.2. There should be no necessary libraries to run the code. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I analyzed a dataset from Kaggle with Seattle Airbnb data. I looked at 3 main questions:

1. Which accomodation features influence the price the most?
2. Which neighbourhoods have the highest prices?
3. Which time of the year is the most expensive one?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

I uploaded one Jupyter Notebook where I analyzed the questions listed above. It is structured as follows:

- Importing Packages (Standard packages like matplotlib, numpy etc.) 
- Loading The Dataset (from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data) and Taking a First Look
- Deriving three interesting questions about the dataset
- Cleaning and Preparing the data (Creating three adjusted dataframes for every question)
- Analyzing the data and answering the questions
- Conclusion

Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here: XXX
